    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is without a doubt everyone’s favorite dish. The boys of the house look forward to 
        this lasagna ever single year. I’ve yet to meet anyone who doesn’t love it. Unless you 
        are vegetarian in which case you should definitely check out my white lasagna.</p>
    <p>The secret is all in the sauce. A slow cooked Bolognese sauce is what makes for the 
        best, classic lasagna. I like to make mine with a mix of vegetables, spicy Italian 
        sausage, lean ground beef, sweet tomatoes, and milk (for richness). It’s basically my 
        slow cooker Bolognese pasta, but instead of serving over pasta, we’re layering it into 
        a lasagna.</p>
    <p>You can cook the sauce in as little as thirty minutes. But I will not lie, it’s so much 
        better if you can simmer the sauce over a low heat for a couple of hours. Even better?
         Simmer the sauce all day and then let chill overnight in the fridge. The added sitting
          time really allows for the flavors to mend and become mouth wateringly delicious. 
          Obviously do what you have time for, either way this will be delicious. But if you 
          can plan ahead, I would recommend doing so. Just make the sauce a day or two ahead of 
          assembling the lasagna.</p>
